**TF Agents** package support gym upto version **gym 0.23.0**. And because the gym management has now handled by **Farama Foundation** as **gymnasium**, there will be no updates in gym so there can be errors because of dependencies.  
To avoid any incompatibility because of package dependencies please install compatible versions of packages to work with Atari and Tf agents. After lots of errors and testing, I found out these versions to be compatible:

python : 3.7.16  
tf_agents : 0.16.0  
tensorflow : 2.11.0  
gym or gym[atari]: 0.23.0  
gym[accept-rom-license] : 0.6.1 (No need to specify version while installing)  
ale-py : 0.7.5 (No need to install separately)  
opencv-python : 4.10.0.82 (No need to specify version while installing)  

I have a added a yml environment file to create a environment with all the packages and versions required.  
To create the environment, run `conda env create --file atari_breakout_env.yml` and then run `conda activate atari-breakout`
