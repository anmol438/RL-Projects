**TF Agents** package support gym upto version **gym 0.23.0**. And because the gym management has move to **Farama Foundation**, there are no updates on gym so they can be errors because of dependencies.  
To avoid any incompatibility because of package dependencies please install compatible versions of packages to work with Atari and Tf agents. After lots of errors and testing, I found out these versions to be compatible:

python : 3.7.16  
tf_agents : 0.16.0  
tensorflow : 2.11.0  
gym or gym[atari]: 0.23.0  
gym[accept-rom-license] : 0.6.1 (No need to specify version while installing)  
ale-py : 0.7.5 (No need to install separately)  
opencv-python : 4.10.0.82 (No need to specify version while installing)
